[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/drougge/gzutil.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/drougge/gzutil)

Helper library used by the [Accelerator](https://github.com/eBay/accelerator).



Use and Purpose
===============

This is one of three repositories that are intended to be used together:
1.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator-project_skeleton
2.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator-gzutil
3.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator

The purpose of the Accelerator project is to allow for fast data processing with big data. Extensive documentation on the purpose and how to use the Accelerator projects is covered in the reference manual found here:

[Reference Manual](https://berkeman.github.io/pdf/acc_manual.pdf) \
[Installation Manual](https://berkeman.github.io/pdf/acc_install.pdf)



Build and Runtime Environment
=============================

The Accelerator projects has been built, tested, and runs on:
 - Ubuntu16.04 and Debian 9,
 - FreeBSD 11.1

but is in no way limited to these systems or versions.

    ```
    cd accelerator-project_skeleton
